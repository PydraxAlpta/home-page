    <h1>Pydrax Alpta</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, welcome to my personal website. I'm Pauras, but you may know me by
      names such as Pyras or Pydrax or PydraxAlpta. Feel free to call me Py.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a web developer by trade, and occasionally also a discord bot
      developer, but I have an interest in learning programming beyond just what
      I work on. I also enjoy raeding, analyzing and discussing fiction a lot,
      so hit me up if you want to do any of that.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I have a variety of projects I have worked on, and sometimes left aside,
      but sometimes spent too much time into. Here's some of these that are
      hosted on the same domain.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://ranker.pydraxalpta.com">Ranker</a> - A tool to make
        rankings. Primarily made with top N characters or top N movies kind of
        lists in mind, but there's nothing stopping you from making a top 10
        smartphones either. You need a discord account to login, part because I
        made this for my discord friends, and part because it lets me not roll
        my own authentication and worry about that aspect of security.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://discord-timestamp.pydraxalpta.com"
          >Discord Timestamp</a
        >
        - A small utility to make timestamps in discord's syntax. I promise you
        this isn't original, in fact it was insprised by a similar and honestly
        better UI designed Hammertime, which also has a bot now. It's one of my
        first ever websites, and I still use it when on PC.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://plvspwaa-dlc-guide.pydraxalpta.com"
          >PLvsPW:AA DLC Guide</a
        >
        - A short guide for playing the Special Episodes and viewing the Special
        Galleries of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. While
        not the most niche game or whatever, it at the time of writing was the
        least accessible one, and for the longest time you could not play the
        DLC on it. The DLC itself is free and part of the game, the actual
        download is just a key distributed for free over spotpass - which isn't
        a thing now either. This is mostly a guide to aid preservation, to
        assist one of the games that is most important to my heart and
        fundamental towards who I am today as a person.

      I use social media (unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately), and you can
